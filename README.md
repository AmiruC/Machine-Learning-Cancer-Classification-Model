# CancerCellClassification - Machine Learning 

Our project is constructed on the foundation of deep learning and computer vision techniques, which enable us to meticulously analyse extensive datasets of medical images, such as X-rays, MRIs, and histopathological slides, with ~84%. By training our machine learning model on diverse and comprehensive datasets, we have achieved the ability to distinguish between healthy and cancerous cells, even in their early stages.
